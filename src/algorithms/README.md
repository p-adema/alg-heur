# Algorithms
This folder contains the algorithms implemented for solving the problem

* `rand.py` is a random constructive algorithm
* `greedy.py` is a simple, greedy, constructive algorithm
* `look_ahead` is a best-first iterative algorithm that explores future possibilities
* `hill_climb` is a simple iterative hill climbing algorithm that takes the first good move
* `sim_annealing` is an iterative algorithm that transitions from semi-random action to hill climbing
