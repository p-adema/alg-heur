This folder contains all the source code for the project

* `algorithms` has the algorithms to solve the problem
* `classes` has classes to represent the problem and its solutions
* `graphs` has functions to visualise algorithms and their solutions
* `statistics` has functions to generate data for visualisations
* `defaults.py` has some default run configurations for algorithms
  * Use `defaults.default_runner.run()` for an easy result
